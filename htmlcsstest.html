    <h4>Understanding structure Learning about markup Tags and elements The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — </br>
        these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag.</br>
        (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.)</br>
        Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags
    </h4>

    <h3>Headings and paragraphs<br> Bold, italic,<br> emphasis Structural and semantic markup </h3>

    <h3>When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page.</br>
        These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.</h3>
    <h3>Structural markup:</h3>
    <h4>the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs</h4>
    <h3>Semantic markup:</h3>
    <h4>which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation </h4>
    <br/> (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on</h4>

    <h1>has six "levels" of headings H1 TO H6 </h1>


    <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
    <p>By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.</p>

    <h3>Bold & Italic</h3>
    <b> BOLD tage</b> The <i>Italic (Italic)</i> also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way</br>
    (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the element does not imply any additional meaning.

    <h1>Superscript Article & Subscript</h1>
    <h3>Superscript Article</h3>
    AAmir<sup>aa</sup>
    <h3>Subscript</h3>
    Ali <sub>Khan</sub>

    <h1>White Space</h1>
    <h3>white space collapsing .</h3>
    You will often see that web page authors take advantage of white space collapsing to indent their code in order to make it easier to follow.

    <h3>Line Breaks Article & Horizontal Rules br and hr tages, empty elements</h3>

    As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. </br>
    But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag br . </br>

    To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the
    <hr /> tag.</br>

    An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. Some web page authors miss this out but it is a good habit to get into.

    <h1>Semantic Markup</h1>

    <h1>Strong & Emphasis strong and em tages</h1>

    The use of the element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.

    </br>By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong>element in bold.</strong> The em element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence
